		<h3>
			What is the most significant thing you have learned about object oriented?
		</h3>
			<p>
				Working with accessor and mutator methods. To me, this epitomizes programming: giving a program commands to "get" and "set" is foundational.
			</p>
		<h3>
			What is the most significant thing you have learned about the effect of the frontend on the backend?
		</h3>
			<p>
				The vision for the user experience will tend to drive the direction of the project, which will end up affecting the development of the backend (and not the other way around). The backend must adapt to the design of the frontend, in most cases.
			</p>
		<h3>
			Why is encapsulation so important?
		</h3>
			<p>
				Encapsulation is a way of isolating a certain part of code within a class for the purpose of restricting access, and which allows for those portions of code to be "hidden" within the program.
